# HP Victus GRUB Theme - Recent Improvements

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses the requested improvements to make the theme look better with enhanced visual elements and improved usability.

## üé® Quote Styling Improvements

**Changes Made:**
- **Font:** Changed from LiberationSerif-Regular-40 to **Roboto-Bold-48** (clean sans-serif)
- **Size:** Increased from 40px to 48px for better visibility
